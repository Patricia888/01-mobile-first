# Mobile First

**Author:** Josh West and Patricia Raftery
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview
This is a practice project. The purpose of it is to create a fun website containing a blog with icons that are appealing to the user, and have the page be responsive so that it looks as desired on both desktop and mobile screens.
The main problem domain has to do with the responsive design of this website. We desire the nav menu to be visible and static to a desktop user, and to a mobile user we desire it to be hidden until the menu icon is hovered over, so that the space the user has is maximized.

## Getting Started
To build this app, starter code must be forked and cloned from GitHub. On the started code, the images and icons needed will be under the styles folder. Once you have familiarized yourself with the code, start by adding the yellow-orange background color to the .site header, adjusting the font sizes of the text and icons, and linking icons and css files. Make an @media with a breakpoint of 640px. Make the nav icons appear inline block for the desktop view and initially hidden for the mobile view. Make the pictures in the main section float right. For the mobile view, make a hover effect in css, and when hovering, make the nav menu visable and display block.

## Architecture
We used html, css, and markdown. This application is a blog of various ipsums. This application is design with mobile first in mind, and extra css code for desktop viewers, with a breakpoint at 640px. The mobile viewers, to maximize screen space, start with the dropdown menu hidden, and the menu becomes visible when the hamburger icon is hovered over. The desktop viewers do not see the hamburger icon, and can see the nav menu from the beginning.
